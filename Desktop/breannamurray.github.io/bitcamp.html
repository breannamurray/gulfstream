                <h3>Friday<small><br>The start of an awesome, disasterous weekend</small></h3>
                
                <p>When I received a notification that I had been accepted to Bitcamp, I knew that I just had to go. This past Friday, I went to the University of Maryland in College Park where I would compete against over 1,000 other hackers in a 36-hour hackathon. The event spanned from Friday night through Sunday morning. I flew into Ronald Reagan Washington airport and rode a subway for the first time ever to College Park. From the metro station, I took a bus which dropped me off right in the middle of the UMD campus. I found my way to the building where the event was being held and since I ended up being a few hours early, I decided to volunteer and help set up. </p>
                <p>After helping to put down chairs, blow up air mattresses, tape cords down, and help direct participants upon arrival, the event finally began and I could get to hacking. While volunteering, I still did not have a team or an idea but I met a really cool guy with a nice web development idea so we decided we would work together. His idea was a website which allowed students across the world to get real-time help from certified professors through real-time video calls or messaging. It would also allow  Awesome, now we just needed two more people to join our team. It shouldn't be hard with so many participants, right? Wrong. Maybe we were just a little too late but everyone we happened to talk to already had a team. We attempted to continue to half-ass recruit two people to our team while we talked and laugh and got to know people.</p>
                <p>It was nearing midnight and we still didn't have the other half of our team, much less start working on our project, but Brendan Iribe, the co-founder and CEO of Oculus was speaking. I struggled to get a clear picture of him while listening to his encouraging words of motivation. Afterwards, he exited the stage and allowed all the hackers to talk to him and ask him any questions we were curious to know. For the whole hour or so that he was there, I just stood in awe taking it all in, like a child finally getting to visit Disney World. I just couldn't believe I finally had the chance to talk to someone so admirable who truly inspired me.</p>
                <p>I finally went back to my table with my partner and at now almost 1AM, we had yet to make any progress with our project. Sure, we probably could have worked through the night and made significant progress, but we were both already pretty tired and weren't even dead set on our project idea yet. My partner left to go sleep and I played around on my laptop for a couple hours and met some more people. Finally, a little after 3AM, I decided to call it a night. After some much needed rest, I would be able to focus better on my project. I set my alarm for 8AM and fell asleep thinking about what other project ideas would be feasible for 2 people to complete. I really wanted to try a hand at a mobile app but maybe we would just have to stick with our current website idea.</p>
                
                
                
                <h3>Saturday<small><br>Getting down to business</small></h3>
                
                <p>Thanks to the air mattresses provided by Bitcamp and the exhausting day before, I slept way better than I should've. It took hitting snooze a few times before I finally opened my eyes around 8:40AM. I did my daily ritual of checking my emails, catching upon social media, and any other text or group messages I may have received. I finally hopped out of my sleeping bag around 9AM and headed to the bathroom to brush my teeth and clean myself up for the day. I grabbed breakfast and met my partner back at the spot we had been at the night before. I checked the schedule for the day and I realized it was about halfway through an Android Development workshop that I had really wanted to attend. I had completely forgot about it! </p>
                <p>I mentioned the idea of creating a mobile app to my partner but it just wasn't realistic. Neither one of us had ever created one before or really knew the technologies used. I had little Java experience and my partner had none. It was clear now that we would just go with our original web app idea with just the two of us. So now we were set on an idea and were ready to FINALLY get to work. Awesome! There was still a problem, however. We are both front-end developers. Awesome. Our idea behind trying to recruit two additional members was that we would obviously have more help but also that we could have two back-end developers while we worked on the front-end. So what now? I created the basic template for the website using Bootstrap while my partner worked on cool features and graphics. I suggested we use a free Bootstrap template on the internet to speed up the process and then we could customize it to our liking. He insisted we code it from scratch to give it the optimal customization and functionality. I agreed. </p>
                <p>Once the basic layout was designed, I decided that I would give the back-end a try while my partner finished developing the front-end. We needed a registration page as well as a login page. It would also be nice to demo an actual chat but we wouldn't worry about that until the end, if we even had time. I began watching YouTube videos and got started trying to code it. Hours later, I had a mySQL database, a little more knowledge of PHP, and a registration and login page which looked nice but didn't work properly. This is the way that it would stay for the duration of the hackathon.</p>
                <p>I tried for several more hours to work out the bugs in my code but it just wasn't cooperating. It was now well into Saturday night and our projects were due in the morning. We had a very nice looking website but none of the features that were supposed to be working, actually worked. I took a break to get dinner and attend a helpful Design workshop. Most of the things I already knew but a little reinforcement never hurts. Plus, it was a nice break from hacking. When I came back, I couldn't help but notice many of the cool projects were working on. Some really cool hardware and virtual reality hacks caught my eye but also made me really question my project. Our project wouldn't compare to some of the other projects even if it was actually working. </p>
                <p>I went back to my seat and debugged my code a bit longer. I just couldn't get it to work. I took a break from that for awhile while I started working on other necessary parts of project such as adding content to the website, adding all of the necessary information about our project on Devpost, and proceeded to create a domain for our site. Somehow we came up with Hackademy and just went with it because we couldn't think of anything better at the moment. As we attempted to set up the hosting and domain for our website, we found neither the free domain or free hosting codes we were given were working. Great. We tried to talk with the organizers about the issue but they couldn't do much. I would have to wait until the MLH mentor came back in the morning because he was now gone for the night. </p>
                <p>Obviously, that wasn't realistic so we would have to figure out an alternative. Great. At this point, I just wanted to get everything working because demoes were just around the corner. I finally called a mentor over, which I should've done forever ago, and they attempted to help me. He steered be in the right direction but there were some small bugs I couldn't seem to work out. By this point, my partner had left since the front-end of the website was pretty much done, and I was still trying to get my parts to work. Extremely frustrated and unmotivated by this point, I just finished up everything else I had been working on and I decided I would take a nap. I hadn't planned on getting any sleep tonight but maybe a bit of rest was all I needed to finish things up. I finally called it a night around 5AM and set my alarm for 7AM the next morning. That would give me a nice 2 hour nap followed by 3 hours to submit the project. As you can imagine by this time, most everybody was asleep so there weren't any mattresses left. I collapsed on the floor and curled up in my sleeping bag.</p>
                
                <h3>Sunday<small><br>Projects are due!</small></h3>
                <p>I knew I didn't have much time this morning so I didn't dare hit snooze. I knew I didn't have much time and I was panicking. I hopped out of my sleeping bag, went to the restroom to brush my teeth, and jolted to the hacking area. I would clean myself up before demoes. I had just under 3 hours to submit the project and no word from my partner. I talked to another mentor to try to get some last minute help with the registration page but I knew it was too late. They were all racing to get things set up in time for the Expo. Her advice was that this happens all the time where people don't finish their project and it isn't fully functional but to just submit what I had anyways. This is great advice for hackathons.  Most people probably would've given up by this point as I probably should've, but I didn't.</p>
                <p>As I was submitting the project, I had a sudden realization. I created the login page but neither of us had created the actual Dashboard page for after users successfully logged in. Shit! This was the biggest fail. If ever there was a time to just say forget it, it was now. It was about an hour before the deadline was due and I was determined to get at least the Dashboard page done. Thankfully, my partner finally texted me but he was still not there. We ended up finding a Dashboard bootstrap template online and customized it to our liking. We hard-coded some things in so that viewers would see the general idea, and we finally submitted it just in time.</p>
                
                <p>I changed my clothes, fixed myself up, and then headed to the Expo. At last, I could relax. As I briefly witnessed the night before, there were some awesome projects which encouraged me to switch things up at the next hackathon I attend and expand on my web development skills. Needless to say, we didn't win anything. It had been a stressful weekend and although I didn't even have much to show for it, I was okay with that. I took away knowledge and lessons which is what I attend hackathons for. I'm learning and that's all that matters. </p>
                
                <h3>Take Away</h3>
                    
                    I learned quite a bit but these are the main lessons I took away that can be applied to attending other hackathons as well as other things:</p>
                <p><center>
                1. Never be afraid to step outside your comfort zone! That is often when you learn the most.<br>
                2. Communication is key.<br>
                3. Github is a lifesaver for developers.<br>
                4. Don't procrastinate! If you're at a hackathon, get started on your project as soon as you have an idea and you can change it as needed.<br>
                5. Networking is extremely important.<br>
                6. If you learned something, you won.<br>
                </center></p>
                <p>Overall, I had a great time at Bitcamp and am so glad I went. Thank you to all of the super cool people I met that made this experience great. I will definitely be at Bitcamp 2017!</p>
